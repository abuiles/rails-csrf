# rails-csrf

ember-cli addon to keep track of your Rails CSRF-token.


## Looking for maintainer

I'm not maintaning this library any more, if you are interested in taking ownership please send me an email.

## Usage

* `npm install rails-csrf --save`

Add a meta tag like the following to your app body and the addon will
do the rest:

```
<meta content="adfadfadsfi34/sdfadfadf=" name="csrf-token">
```
